What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	A .git directory is built inside that repository which contanins all
	the history related information of that repository. We need to do it 
	to change the normal directory to a git repository so we can use git 
	commands on it in the future.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

	A staging area is an intermediate workspace where we can add files 
	which need to be committed. It is a specific part of the repository 
	or the working directory which comprises of the files being part of
	the next commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your
history organized? How would branches help?

	When we are making certain extensions to some project and we don't 
	want to break the existing code by trying out some new variations.
