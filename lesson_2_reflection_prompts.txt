What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	A .git directory is built inside that repository which contanins all
	the history related information of that repository. We need to do it

	commands on it in the future.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

	A staging area is an intermediate workspace where we can add files 
	which need to be committed. It is a specific part of the repository 
	or the working directory which comprises of the files being part of
	the next commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your
history organized? How would branches help?

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

	Diagrams help to visualize the timeline of the commits and the logical
	paths the project is taking which is very helpful.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent
it in the diagram the way we do?

	It results in the logical merging of the files of the snapshots. The

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

	Git's automatic merging is pretty smart as it knows when to leave 
	the control to the author when there are conflicts, which is in 
	present the best thing to do. On the other hand it easily does the
	easy merges saving us the time of copy pasting code from one commit
	to another.
